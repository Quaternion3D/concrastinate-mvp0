        ### Problem Statement

        In this post, I may vaguely refer to "the problem". This is because the problem itself is multifaceted and hard to pinpoint.
        This entire article is basically an attempt to describe the problem. But the gist of it is that for whatever reason,
        I procrastinate and indulge in the internet
        or video games to the point where it interferes with my school, my personal life, my work, and my social life / relationships.
        The majority of the time, I do this because I'm trying to escape or cope with stress, anxiety, negative emotions, or just boredom.
        However in addition to that, at this point I believe it has simply become a habit. After years of exposing my brain to hours and hours, day after day
        of continuous novelty and stimulus through the internet, my neural pathways have been warped to crave a
        constant stream of easily digestable entertainment, like mental fast food.

        I wanted to create this site because I feel like this is a big problem in my life, but when I try searching online for help, I can't find much.
        The majority of articles I've found on this topic often do a relatively good job of describing and providing evidence for the problem, but that's it.
        They don't offer adequate solutions, they just say "try thinking one step at a time" or "be positive" or something flimsy and vague like that.
        What I'm looking for is more rigorous guidance, like a program to follow or at least one site that has all the info collected in one place.


        ### Background

        __Middle School__

        For me, this problem extends almost as far back as I can remember, at least from the beginning of grade 7 (age 12) when my classmates and I
        would play video games on our laptops in class. Thing is, back then it wasn't really a problem, I was ahead in math because my parents
        had pushed me to take extracurricular math classes, and I guess all my other classes were easy enough that you could do well
        without necessarily paying attention every class. Of course, my grades weren't as high as they should have been, and I remember
        stressing out about this when attending an open house for the high school I was applying to, and worrying if my grades would be
        good enough to get in.

        __High School__

        Nevertheless, I got into that high school in the end, so no punishments there. The first two years of high school were similar, low stakes,
        minimal punishment for underperforming, boring classes that were easy enough to catch up on. Grade 11 is where I would say the problem really
        began. Now, classes actually began to matter because they would factor into university applications. But that didn't make me like them
        more, it just stressed me out more. And so my procrastination intensified. I would escape the negative feelings of work by browsing /r/videos
        and youtube, or playing video games. And the more I put off my work, the closer to the deadline I would get, the more stressed out I would feel,
        so the harder I would try to avoid it. And to me, getting into the right university was a big deal, it felt like that alone would determine
        the direction of my entire life.

        At this point, I became conscious that there was a problem. I realized that although logically I __knew__ how important it was to get my work done,
        and despite all the detailed plans I created for myself, it didn't matter because for some reason I just could not get myself to do it when
        the time came. I couldn't understand why this was, it felt like I should be able to just decide for myself when to work. It all seemed so clear
        to me what I needed to do and I should be able to just do it, but every time I sat down at my computer I would have strong urges to hit open a
        new tab and go to facebook or reddit or youtube. Next thing I knew, 2 hours had passed and all I had done was watch a bunch of fail army videos
        on youtube. And of course, after those two hours it felt even harder to stop and begin working, it didn't feel like my brain had just rested
        and was now ready to work, my brain felt even more tired than before.

        I guess I was really lucky that in the program I was in, 80% of your final grade is determined by a final exam. Normally,
        this would awful. But for me, my regular grade was already shit. And if there's one thing I was good at, it was pulling through at the last
        second. I'm sure I spent most of reading week not even studying, just
        agonizing in no man's land, unable to allow myself to procrastinate but also unable to make myself study. It was only a day or two before
        the exam that the pressure would finally drive me into a panic and I would cram my ass off.

        Of course, I followed the same pattern for SAT. Had the book and everything for months, never touched it. Never even scheduled to take the test
        until it was almost too late, and I took the last available one. So I had only one shot, no retakes, and I hadn't studied, I just relied on
        raw intelligence to carry me. And somehow that was enough, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. Good, of course because I got what I wanted,
        but bad because that's why I never learned my lesson. I was never really punished for procrastinating, somehow I always scraped through.

        __University__

        I don't know how I got into the university that I did, but it happened I recognized that I was getting a clean slate, and I shouldn't fuck it up this time.
        I made all kinds of promises to myself, that I would go to class and pay attention, I would study, I would start on homework as soon as
        it was assigned and finish it early rather than waiting for the deadline.

        And you know what happened? Nothing new. My first semester I got a C- in physics, it was at 8am and I often didn't go because I didn't
        wake up in time. So from the get-go, my GPA was shit, and I never had incentive to keep it high because it was never high. After the novelty
        of university life wore off, I was back in the same rut. In some ways it didn't feel as bad, because nobody was forcing me to sit in class and
        wish I was somewhere else anymore. But for that same reason, it was also worse. There was nobody to hold me accountable on anything. First I skipped
        classes, then I skipped homeworks because I didn't know the material necessary to do it. I never skipped exams, but I definitely failed a bunch
        of them. I was nearly dismissed from my university not once, but twice in my four years there. Somehow, I scraped through and got my degree.

        ### Summary

        For at least the past 6 years, I've had a pretty much constant feeling of dissatisfaction. Sometimes it feels much worse than other times, but overall
        always there. And the reason seems to be that I'm not accomplishing (or even working towards) the things I think I want to be or
        should be doing. It often feels like I'm not in control. I constantly make plans for what I will do, and for some reason I never do them.
        I have a very ambitious imagination, and I've always set these ridiculous, dreamy, delusional goals for myself.
        Which is fine, but the thing is apparently I have no backend to support that and make it happen.
        Not only do I not achieve my goals, I don't even start on them. And that giant disparity tortures the shit out of me.

        First, it started with avoiding school work. Tasks that I don't want to do give me anxiety and stress me out, so if I have time to put it off, I will. And of course,
        I always have time to put it off. Until I don't. Then it becomes a last second scramble, I do a shitty job (if I do it at all), and I enter a spiral of self loathing,
        which of course leads to more procrastination, escapism, and self-soothing, which of course takes my mind away temporarily but ultimately
        makes me more depressed and out of control.

        Then I realized it had metastasized to my personal projects. Here, I'm not so sure it's procrastination anymore, because it's not something
        bad like homework that I'm putting off. Now it's just I can't stop watching videos or playing video games because it's too tempting, too habitual.
        And often projects are difficult, there are hurdles, challenges to overcome, problem to troubleshoot.
        Sometimes when starting a new project I might be super enthusiastic and spend a few hours on it,
        but as soon as it loses its novelty charm or I run into a road block that I have to struggle with, I quit. Watching videos is just so much easier.
        Plus my brain is literally addicted to it and craving the hits of dopamine that you get from watching video after video. So much so that
        I was no longer able to get enough dopamine from doing normal but challenging things like side projects.

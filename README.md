# concrastinate-mvp0


### Dec 11, 2017
* initialized in new repo although I realized it already exists as a subfolder of the concrastin8 repo (on Quaternion3D)
* that repo has web app stuff though and there's too much in it, too confusing so I made this to extract mvp0

* removing the about me page because nobody cares about you
* chopped landing page in half because a full page with just the definition of concrastinate seems wasteful, now it's more like a banner
* also think I'm going to get rid of the bs markety stuff.

* I think at first it really hit me how ugly this design is, but now I kind of like the gray color scheme. It feels
pure and relaxing compared to colorful attempts at drawing in your engagement.
